###🎨 Design Choices & UX Decisions
✳️ Layout
Designed to be simple and readable with logical sections: About, Projects, Skills, Education, and Contact.

Each section uses spacing and section headers to create visual hierarchy and separation.

✳️ Color Scheme
Primary highlight color: rgb(252, 184, 49) — a warm amber shade used for headings and buttons.

Background: dark theme for visual contrast and modern aesthetic.

Text: white and light gray shades to ensure readability against dark backgrounds.

✳️ Responsiveness
Flexbox is used to ensure consistent layout across different screen sizes.

Social icons and project cards are wrapped to accommodate mobile and tablet screens.

✳️ Fonts & Icons
Clean sans-serif fonts are used for modern, accessible design.

All social media icons (GitHub, LinkedIn, Instagram, Gmail) are standardized with object-fit and fixed sizes for visual consistency.

Hover effects on icons and buttons for better user interaction.

✳️ Resume Button
Resume is linked using a Google Drive public link.

Opens in a new tab for convenience using target="_blank".
